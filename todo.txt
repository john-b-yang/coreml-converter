To Do's:
- Fill in basic UI functions (i.e. place buttons, labels in the correct positions)
- Figure out how to upload files to a server
- Figure out how to download files to a user
- Wireframe different categories for different ML problems (classification, prediction, etc.)
- Create Core ML Model

In Process:
- Function that takes in raw confusion matrix + classification report strings and makes them human readable
- Convert to CoreML mlmodel file given 1. model 2. data set

Completed:
- Begin writing python script to process data based on parameters
    * Better to ask user for what 'Y' Column is, as opposed to forcing formatting to first column
    * Be careful of "Unnamed: 0" column, generated as a result of preserving index in original CSV
    * Use the DS100 Environment
    * python -W ignore -B script.py (ignore warnings + don't generate compiled pyc files)
    * Titanic Sample Entry:
        x Enter path pointing to data file: ./test_sets/titanic_data_filtered.csv
        x Enter test split percentage: 50
        x Enter models to test, separated by spaces: knn decision-trees svc random-forest gradient-boosted
        x Enter column name of Y/Label data: Survived

Tips & Tricks:
- Errors (Flask + Jinja):
    * The method is not allowed for the requested URL. (http://bit.ly/2DuxIJT)
    * The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.
    * Form Sending Issues: http://bit.ly/2Do2rVs
- 'Form' tag (HTML)
    * value: what's displayed on/in the field
    * name: the alias for the value of that input field
- Python Specifics
    * Relative import paths within python files: http://bit.ly/2g93eDE
